# Karolina Kulpinska - Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This week my job was to design and code my personal portfolio website using Bootstrap so that it meets challenge's criteria:
The website should include:
* A navigation bar with menu on top and links applicable to my portfolio (links should navigate to appropriate sections);
* A hero/jumbotron section featuring my picture, name and any other information I'd like to include;
* A work section displaying my projects in grid;
* Bootstrap cards for each project with a brief description of the work;
* A skills section (listing skills I'm expecting to learn from the bootcamp);
* An about me section;
* A contact me section;
* A footer section;
* Hyperlinks with a hover effect;
* Buttons with a box shadow displaying upon hover.


I've also made sure that the application:
* loads with no errors;
* resembles the functionality of my previous portfolio made with just HTML and CSS as close as possible;
* follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions as well as class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
